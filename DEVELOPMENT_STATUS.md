## 🚧 In Progress

### GUI Integration
- ⏳ egui-based user interface (framework ready)
- ⏳ GPU-accelerated rendering with WGPU
- ⏳ Terminal display and interaction panels
- ⏳ AI chat panel integration
- ⏳ File explorer sidebar

## 🎯 Current Status

The ANTRAFT project successfully compiles and runs with a functional CLI interface. All core modules are implemented and ready for integration:

```bash
# Working commands:
cargo run                    # Start ANTRAFT
cargo run -- --help        # Show help
cargo run -- --debug       # Enable debug logging
cargo run -- -w /path      # Start in specific directory
```

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Optional Security Tools:
```bash
pip install bandit semgrep
go install github.com/google/osv-scanner/cmd/osv-scanner@v1
```
